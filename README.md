# Lucas Mod Launcher Lua Definitions
This repository contains a Lua file of definitions for custom Lua functions build in to [Lucas' Simpsons Hit & Run Mod Launcher](https://modbakery.donutteam.com/releases/view/6).

## Usage
This file is designed for use with the [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/).

The easiest way to make use of it is by using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and installing the [Lua Extension by Sumneko](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua).

Once you install the extension, place the Lua file anywhere in your project (we recommend "<YourModName>/Resources/lib"). The extension will automatically pick up the file and provide you with autocompletion and documentation for the custom functions.
